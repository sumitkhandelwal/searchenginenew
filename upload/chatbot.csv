Some data may be used in a confirmatory way typically to verify that a given set of input to a given function produces some expected result. Other data may be used in order to challenge the ability of the program to respond to unusual extreme exceptional or unexpected input. Test data may be produced in a focused or systematic way (as is typically the case in domain testing or by using other less-focused approaches (as is typically the case in high-volume randomized automated tests). Test data may be produced by the tester or by a program or function that aids the tester. Test data may be recorded for re-use or used once and then forgotten. Test data can be created 1) manually 2) by using data generation tools or 3) it can be retrieved from existing production environment.
